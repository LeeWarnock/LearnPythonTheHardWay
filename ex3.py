# Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python? Start python this way again and using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
# Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
# Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
# Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
